# BST-Modelling-Tool
Create, visualise and modify binary search tree.


## Installation:
There is an BST-Tool.jar artifact attached in releases. JRE that supports at least Java 8 is needed to run it (v. 251).
To compile the project it is best to use Intellij Idea, as it was used originally.

* add nodes
* delete nodes
* generate pseudorandom tree
* balance tree
* find nodes
* display traversal results (inorder, preorder, postorder)
* display all the nodes in linear structure
